## Core Requirements

Handle <strong class="green">collisions</strong> in the (incorrect!) implementation from the [lecture](/hashing.qmd):

{{< include badDictCodeWithHint.qmd >}}

## Extra credit opportunities

Extra credit for <strong class="pink">creative</strong> hash functions and collision strategies\*

<small>\* Solutions that employ forms of [acceptable cheating](#acceptable-cheating) are not eligible for extra credit</small>

Things to inspect that might help:

- Look inside the `data.json` and `test.py` files; is the test code using keys in a way that you could exploit to hash quickly, and avoid collitions?
- Extra credit will be awarded separately to the most performant solution *for each type of key*. 

## Running and testing your solution 

Download and extract the [assignment](/linkNowhere.zip)

<strong class="teal">ONLY EDIT</strong> the `dictionary.py` file

To test for correctness, run `python test.py`

To test for performance, run `python benchmark.py`

<small>After the last assignment, that code should look familiar!</small>

## Acceptable cheating

As with other assignments in this course, <strong class="purple">collaboration</strong> and <strong class="pink">creative ways around the problem</strong> are encouraged!

Copypasta from Stackoverflow or AI-generated solutions are also allowed (but discouraged).

However, in all cases when you copy something you didn't write, or when you're up to something sneaky, you <strong class="orange">MUST COMMENT YOUR CODE</strong>, or you risk getting a <strong class="orange">ZERO</strong> on the assignment (fully up to the discretion of the instructor).

To stay safe, make sure that you include comments that:

- Give props about <strong class="purple">who</strong> and <strong class="purple">how</strong> specific classmates helped you
- Cite the source websites / tools that helped you, how they helped you, and for which chunks of code they helped you
- For <strong class="pink">workarounds</strong>, describe how you're avoiding the spirit of the assignmentâ€”I want to know that you know what you're doing

Also, for this assignment, any acceptable cheating will disqualify your submission for extra credit.

*Hint: It's possible to complete this assignment using the existing python `dict`, and/or ignore the `capacity` setting to achieve better performance. If your solution ignores `capacity`, you must document how / why in order to recieve credit!*

## What to submit

Upload your modified `dictionary.py` file here:

<form>
  <fieldset>
    <label for="studentId">Your student ID</label>
    <input type="text" id="studentId"/>
  </fieldset>
  <fieldset>
    <label for="extraCredit">Test my code for potential extra credit!</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="extraCredit"/>
    <br/>
    <small class="orange">Please do NOT check this box if we'd be likely to consider your solution to be [acceptable cheating](#acceptable-cheating)</small>
  </fieldset>
  <fieldset>
    <input type="file"/>
  </fieldset>
  <fieldset>
    <button>Submit</button>
